# CSharp_Alarm_WebAndForm
 C# Application on Web and Form to practice bit of javascript and form application

 
# Alarm Video 
Both Web and App should be the same. It’s a challenge exercise for me to both sharpen my Web application in javascript and Windows Form Application.
In order for application to work: It is looking for either these two lines:
-	The alarm id from video server number X is Y.
-	Alarm id Y has been received from video server number X.
Where X and Y represents the Number.

Note to Self: Bit of issue with loading IISExpress with Alarm Web Application. It would either state “Unable to connect IIS” or “IIS is running”
Look into this matter.



# Database SQL – Practice with Alarm Video
These SQL script may be needed in future but for right now, its just sharpening and learning SQL scripts. 
Note to self: Definetly try out complicated JOINS and have fun with it :D
